# Data-Structures-and-File-Handling.
This is basically a mini voting system i have coded using DS adn file handling.
Instead of using simple arrays and finishing things off i have used Heap data structure instead.
Candidates in the code is taken as user input. 
Voters.txt file can be changed as per requirements.
This also a mini project only for data structure in my uni :).
